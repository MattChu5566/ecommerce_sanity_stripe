## About
This is a practice following the tutorial of [JavaScript Mastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/ecommerce_sanity_stripe).

Some new features/modifications by myself:
- Trying NextJS 13 App router. The approach to fetch data, create dynamic routes, manipulate server/client component and define route handlers are different from a Page router.
- Hand-crafted carousel in the home page hero banner.
- Rewrite CSS with Tailwind.
- Using intercepting routes in NextJS to present the image modal.
- Add a loading page.
- Store cart info. in localStorage.
- Remove unnecessary React state.

Welcome to take a look at [https://ecommerce-sanity-stripe-one-sable.vercel.app/](https://ecommerce-sanity-stripe-one-sable.vercel.app/) 

## NextJS
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
